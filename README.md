Recap
-----

In lesson 3 we built a listings page and started using AJAX/PJAX to make it dynamic


Lesson 3 
--------

Start by switching to the lesson4 branch: `git fetch --all && git checkout lesson3`

Let's continue building out our listings page. We can:

* Fix any bugs with our event listeners.
* Introduce Autocomplete
* Use pushState to make it real PJAX
* Start using Autowire to expose our backend service
* Start using ScalaTags to share our template/view
