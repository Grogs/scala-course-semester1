Recap
-----

In lesson 5 introduced Li Haoyi's ScalaTags library to do HTML templating. 
This allowed us to write a template that can be shared across the client and the server.  

We also introduced Li Haoyi's Autowire library, which allowed to expose our HotelsService API to the client. 
This is very extensible and will allow us to very easily expose new methods to the API without any additional changes.
