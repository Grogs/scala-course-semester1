Recap
-----

In lesson 2 we took the HotelCatalogueService, added two more services, and built an endpoint to return Hotels in JSON given some destination name and radius.

How did everyone get on with that?

Let's go through the bits we didn't finish, and the dependency injection that we blazed through.


Lesson 3 
--------

Now we have an endpoint to get hotel data, let's create a listings page.

Prerequisites:

1. Switch to the lesson3 branch: `git fetch --all && git checkout lesson3`
