Recap
-----

In lesson 4 added AJAX to our listings page. We also introduced Autocompletion of the destination, and used pushState to update the page's history as the listings changed.


Lesson 5
--------

Start by switching to the lesson5 branch: `git fetch --all && git checkout lesson5`

Let's continue building out our listings page. We can:

* Start using Autowire to expose our backend service
* Start using ScalaTags to share our template/view
